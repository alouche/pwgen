### Firefox Reviews

>Just brilliant...absolutely brilliant. I don't have to bother with trying to think of passwords, nor the time to write them down so I don't forget them. Just click and paste and save time. ~TheDragon

>This is absolutely one of my most essential addons as an I.T. Admin. Thank you so much for it! A feature I would like to see implemented at some point is the ability to add a phonetic pronunciation output e.g. in parenthesis with each letters phonetic word separated by dashes. ~StormKnight

>Very nice add-on. Does what I want (generate strong passwords) and nothing more (doesn't try to take over my password manager). Only thing I'd like to see changed is to allow the icon to be a toolbar button rather than a status bar icon. ~Mike Cooper

>Useful thing, for everyday recording at different sites... ~Mafusail

>Perfect for all my database passwords and well, for everything really. Thanks! ~Aeryith
